# Icecat Taxonomy Dashboard 📊

This interactive dashboard visualizes the results of the unsupervised clustering analysis on the Icecat dataset. It allows you to explore the discovered taxonomy, search for specific categories, and analyze the performance of different clustering algorithms.

## Features

-   **Real-time Data Exploration**: Browse and search through all 20,805 discovered clusters.
-   **Cluster Deep Dive**: Click on any category to see detailed statistics including purity, size, and ID.
-   **Subcategory Breakdown**: View the composition of each cluster (e.g., 90% Laptops, 10% Tablets) to understand impurity sources.
-   **Interactive Sankey Diagram**: Visualize the flow and mapping between true categories and discovered clusters.
-   **Algorithm Comparison**: View side-by-side performance metrics for BIRCH, MiniBatchKMeans, and others.
-   **Responsive Design**: Built with a modern, dark-themed UI that works on all devices.

## How to Run

Since the dashboard loads data from local JSON files, you might encounter CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues if you just open the file directly in some browsers.

### Option 1: VS Code Live Server (Recommended)
1.  Open the project in VS Code.
2.  Right-click `dashboard.html`.
3.  Select "Open with Live Server".

### Option 2: Python Simple Server
Run the following command in your terminal from the project root:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open your browser to: `http://localhost:8000/dashboard.html`

### Option 3: Direct Open (Safari/Firefox)
You may be able to open `dashboard.html` directly in Safari or Firefox, but Chrome usually blocks local file fetches.

## Data Sources

-   `outputs/cluster_data.json`: Contains the full list of clusters with their size, purity, and dominant category.
-   `outputs/sankey_BIRCH.html`: The interactive Sankey diagram generated by the analysis pipeline.
